# JetDialog (jdialog)

A simple GTK application wiritten in C to provide the 'dialog' terminal UI
tool with any desktop.
It is fully written in C and GTK, so it is fast and should be runable under alot
of operating systems but it is designed for LINUX/UNIX

## Goals

 * Provide a simple to use/reliable tool
 * Full compatability to `dialog` [NOT YET]
 * Might extend the functions of `dialog`
